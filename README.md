Check out Dev Ed's YT vid for this todo app: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ&t=4s. Todo apps are a great way to get started with React and Dev Ed does a great job with not just the project but also explaining every required React concept for this app.

### Features of this simple todo app:
1. You can add todo lists just as the name suggests
2. You can edit, mark complete and delete the todos
3. You can filter out the todos based on completedness
4. The app keeps a track of number of completed/uncompleted and total number of todos
5. You start of as a GUEST but can add your name by clicking on the previous name
6. The small 'clear all' text button will clear all the todos
7. Snackbar from Notistack has been used to make sure that the user is not allowed to add an empty todo
8. Finally, the local storage ensures that the user's name and todo's are not lost with refresh


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
